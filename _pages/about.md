I just got my Ph.D degree in Computer Engineering at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). I am working with professor Qing Liu from Helen and John C. Hartmann Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. My research area is big data management including data compression, storage, analysis and managing I/O performance on High-Performance Computing systems. I received my Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from NJIT in 2017 and Bachelor's degree from Northwestern Polytechnical University, China, in 2013, respectively.
